<h4>‚ùùConvey from me, even if it is one verse‚ùû</h4>

<hr/>

<p>
<b>Question</b>: Is da‚Äôwah (calling) to All√¢h obligatory upon every Muslim man and woman, or is it to be left for the Scholars and the students of knowledge only? Is it permissible for the lay person to do da‚Äôwah to All√¢h?
</p>
<p>
<b>Answer</b>: ‚ÄúWhen a person has knowledge and insight into that which he is calling to, then there is no difference between the one who has a great amount of knowledge, or a student of knowledge who has recently started in pursuit of knowledge or a lay person - as long as he has certain knowledge of the issue at hand.
</p>
<p>
The Prophet sallall√¢hu ‚Äôalayhi wa sallam said: ‚Äú<b>Convey from me, even if it is one verse.</b>‚Äù [al-Bukhaaree] So it is not a condition upon the d√¢‚Äô√Æ (the one calling) to attain a great amount of knowledge, but the condition is that one must have knowledge of what one is calling to. If this calling is established upon ignorance and built upon emotion and passion, then it is not permissible. Thus, we see that some of the brothers who call to All√¢h, they do not have except a little knowledge. We see them, due to their strong emotions, prohibiting that which All√¢h has not prohibited, whilst making obligatory that which All√¢h has not made obligatory upon His worshippers.
</p>
<p>
This is a very dangerous matter, since permitting what All√¢h has made har√¢m (unlawful) is like prohibiting what All√¢h has made hal√¢l (lawful). So when they begin prohibiting people for making a particular matter then others will rebuke them for making it har√¢m. All√¢h - the Most High - says: ‚Äú<b>And do not say, concerning that which your tongues falsely put forward, ‚ÄòThis is lawful and this is forbidden,‚Äô so as to invent lies against All√¢h. Indeed, those who invent lies against All√¢h will never prosper.</b>‚Äù [an-Nahl 16:116-117]
</p>
<p>
As for the lay person, then he must not call to All√¢h if he does not have knowledge. Rather, it is essential to have knowledge in accordance with the saying of All√¢h - the Most High -: ‚Äú<b>Say : This is my path. I call to All√¢h upon sure knowledge.</b>‚Äù [Yoosuf 12:108]
</p>
<p>
So it is a must to call to All√¢h upon knowledge. However, if a matter is clearly known to be evil or good, then one can command it - if it is good, or forbid it - if it is evil. So the callers to All√¢h must start with knowledge.
</p>
<p>
<i>Whosoever calls to All√¢h without knowledge, then such a person will cause greater harm than good - as is evident. So it is obligatory for a person to first acquire knowledge, then to do da‚Äôwah. As for the clear evils and that which is clearly good, then the good is enjoined and the evil prohibited.</i>
