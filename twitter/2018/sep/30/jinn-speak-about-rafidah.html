<h4>What the Jinn says about Raafidah</h4>

<hr/>

<p>Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer – Allaah have mercy upon him – reports the following incident in his tafseer of Surah Al-Jinn, verse 11:</p>

<p>Ahmad b. Sulaymaan al-Najjaad said in his Amaalee: … Abu Mu’aawiyah said, I heard Al-A’mash say,</p>

<p>A jinni once came to us and I asked him: ‘<b>what is the favorite food amongst you?</b>’</p>

<p>He replied, ‘<b>Rice.</b>’</p>

<p><i>So we gave some to them and I saw handfuls of rice being lifted and I couldn’t see anyone [picking them up].</i></p>

<p>I asked, ‘<b>Do these false desires (bid’ah) that are amongst us exist amongst you?</b>’</p>

<p>He replied, ‘<b>Yes.</b>’</p>

<p>I asked, ‘<b>How are the Raafidah amongst you?</b>’</p>

<p>He replied, ‘<b>The worst of us.</b>’”</p>

<p><i>Ibn Katheer said, ‘I presented this chain of narration to our Shaykh, Al-Haafidh Abu Al-Hajjaaj Al-Mizzee and he said, ‘This chain of narration is saheeh all the way to Al-A’mash.’</i></p>
