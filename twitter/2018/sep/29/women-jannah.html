<h4>
The Righteous Woman In Paradise Is More Beautiful
</h4>

<hr/>

<p>Imam Qurtubi [رحمه الله] said:</p>
<p>
❝The state of the believing Muslim woman in Paradise is better than that of the Hoor al-A'yin [women of Paradise] she also has a higher status and is more beautiful.
 <br/>
The righteous woman is from the people of the Duniya, when she enters Paradise she enters it as a reward for good deeds and an honour for her from Allaah for her Deen and righteousness.
 <br/>
As for the Hoor [woman of Paradise] who is from the delight of Paradise was created in Paradise for other than her and is placed as a reward for the believer for good deeds. 
 <br/>
There is a huge difference between the one who enters Paradise as a reward for her good deeds and who was created as a reward for the person who has good deeds. 
 <br/>
The first is a righteous woman who is a queen, a lady who has a high status, the second is the Hoor al-A'yin even though she has a great status and beauty but as far as is understood by the people, she is lesser than a queen, and she follows the command of her master the believing man, Allaah created her as a reward for him.❞
