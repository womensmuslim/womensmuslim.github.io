<h4>
Splitting and Differing Ummah
</h4>

<hr/>
<p>
The Messenger (‎صلى الله عليه و سلم) said,
</p>
<p>
"The Jews split into 71 sects, and the Christians split into 72 sects. <b>My nation</b> is going to split into 73 sects, and all of them will be in the Hellfire except one.” <br/>
It was said, “<b>Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?</b>” He replied, 
“<b>They those who are upon what I and my Companions are upon.</b>”
</p>
<p>📚 From an authentic hadeeth collected by Aboo Daawood, At-Tirmithee, Ibn Maajah, and others. Al-Albaanee discusses its different chains and wordings in Silsilatul-Ahaadeethis-Saheehah (203-204).]
