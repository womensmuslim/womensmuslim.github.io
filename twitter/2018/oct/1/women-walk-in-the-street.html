<h4>The Etiquette of Women walking in the Street : Tafsir Ibn Kathir</h4>
<hr/>

<p><i>Allah’s saying: (And let them not stamp their feet…)</i></p>

<p>During Jahiliyyah, when women walked in the street wearing anklets and no one could hear them, they would stamp their feet so that men could hear their anklets ringing. Allah forbade the believing women to do this.</p>

<p>By the same token, if there is any other kind of adornment that is hidden, women are forbidden to make any movements that would reveal what is hidden, because Allah says: (And let them not stamp their feet…) to the end of it.</p>

<p>From that, women are also prohibited from wearing scent and perfume when they are going outside the home, lest men should smell their perfume. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:</p>

<p><i>Every eye commits fornication and adultery, and when a woman puts on perfume and passes through a gathering, she is such and such) — meaning an adulteress.</i></p>

<p>He said, “And there is a similar report from Abu Hurayrah, and this is Hasan Sahih.” It was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i.</p>

<p>By the same token, women are also forbidden to walk in the middle of the street, because of what this involves of wanton display.</p>

<p>Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Usayd Al-Ansari said that he heard the Messenger of Allah , as he was coming out of the Masjid and men and women were mixing in the street, telling the women:</p>

<p><i>(Keep back, for you have no right to walk in the middle of the street. You should keep to the sides of the road.)</i></p>

<p>The women used to cling to the walls so much that their clothes would catch on the walls.</p>

<p>(<i>And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.</i>) means, practice what you are commanded in these beautiful manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and give up the evil ways of the people of Jahiliyyah, for the greatest success is to be found in doing what Allah and His Messenger command and avoiding what He forbids.</p>

<p>And Allah is the source of strength.</p>
