<h4>Calamity is a lesson in Tawheed, faith and trust in Allaah</h4>
<hr/>
<p>Ibn al-Qayyim [â€ŽØ±Ø­Ù…Ù‡ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡] said:</p>

<p>Were it not that Allaah treats His slaves with the remedy of trials and calamities, they would transgress and overstep the mark. When Allaah wills good for His slaves, He gives him the medicine of calamities and trials according to his situation, so as to cure him from all fatal illnesses and diseases, until He purifies and cleanses him, and then makes him qualified for the most honourable position in this world, which is that of being a true slave of Allaah (â€˜uboodiyyah), and for the greatest reward in the Hereafter, which is that of seeing Him and being close to Him.</p>
